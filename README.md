Useful functions to filter out words based on wordle mechanics.

The menu gives you options to discard words from the list based on:
- Gray squares: letters that are not in use in the word
- Yellow squares: letters that are in use but should be in a different position
- Green squares: letters that should appear in a determined position

A dictionary of 4k plus five letter words is included.
